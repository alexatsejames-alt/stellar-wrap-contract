#![cfg(test)]

//! Tests for the WASM upgrade path and the `contract_version()` counter.
//!
//! `admin::upgrade` bumps `DataKey::ContractVersion`, emits an
//! `("upgrade", version)` audit event carrying the new WASM hash, and then
//! calls `update_current_contract_wasm`. The timelocked upgrade
//! (`TimelockAction::Upgrade`) must behave the same way.
//!
//! The Soroban test host registers contracts defined in the current crate
//! natively (not as Wasm) and allows uploading a zero-byte Wasm blob — the
//! same executable marker native test contracts are registered with. Tests
//! therefore upload a second Wasm and upgrade to it: the full upgrade path
//! (admin auth, version bump, audit event, `update_current_contract_wasm`)
//! runs, while the contract keeps dispatching to the native implementation so
//! `contract_version()` stays callable afterwards.
//!
//! ## State-migration story (issue #883)
//!
//! An upgrade may change *code* freely, but it may **not** silently change the
//! layout of a persisted type. The storage schema version (issue #290) is the
//! contract between the stored data and the code that reads it: an upgrade
//! that expects a different schema version than the one stored must be
//! rejected, and a layout change must ship with an explicit migration.
//!
//! The tests below pin that policy down:
//! * `test_upgrade_rejects_schema_version_mismatch` — an upgrade whose
//!   expected schema version differs from the stored one is refused.
//! * `test_upgrade_across_layout_change_migrates_stored_records` — a real
//!   persisted layout change with records already stored is migrated eagerly
//!   during the upgrade, and the records read back correctly afterwards.
